## Tech Stack 

* React Framework: NextJS
* UI Library: AWS Amplify UI primitives
* API: GraphQL via AWS AppSync
* File uploads: Sent to Amazon S3
* Signup/SignIn: Managed with Cognito
* Backend Binding: amplify-js 

ðŸš¨ Note that this project does not create our backend servies via the Amplify CLI, but relies on exported values from the AWS CDK.

## Steps to get started

Once the backend is deployed, it will output a set of values and store them in a `config.json` file.

1. Run `amplify init`
2. Run `amplify add codegen --apiId YOUR_APPID`
3. `amplify codegen` (accept the defaults, but set the max-depth to 4)
4. Bring over the values from your CDK backend and ensure your project looks like the `sample.aws-exports.js` file.
5. Run the app and create 2 users
6. Create rooms in the AWS Console (`createRoom` mutation)
7. You should now be able to view the rooms on the homepage. Click one and begin creating messages.
